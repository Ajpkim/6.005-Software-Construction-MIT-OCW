/**
 * A graph-based poetry generator.
 * 
 * <p>GraphPoet is initialized with a corpus of text, which it uses to derive a
 * word affinity graph.
 * Vertices in the graph are words. Words are defined as non-empty
 * case-insensitive strings of non-space non-newline characters. They are
 * delimited in the corpus by spaces, newlines, or the ends of the file.
 * Edges in the graph count adjacencies: the number of times "w1" is followed by
 * "w2" in the corpus is the weight of the edge from w1 to w2.
 * 
 * <p>For example, given this corpus:
 * <pre>    Hello, HELLO, hello, goodbye!    </pre>
 * <p>the graph would contain two edges:
 * <ul><li> ("hello,") -> ("hello,")   with weight 2
 *     <li> ("hello,") -> ("goodbye!") with weight 1 </ul>
 * <p>where the vertices represent case-insensitive {@code "hello,"} and
 * {@code "goodbye!"}.
 * 
 * <p>Given an input string, GraphPoet generates a poem by attempting to
 * insert a bridge word between every adjacent pair of words in the input.
 * The bridge word between input words "w1" and "w2" will be some "b" such that
 * w1 -> b -> w2 is a two-edge-long path with maximum-weight weight among all
 * the two-edge-long paths from w1 to w2 in the affinity graph.
 * If there are no such paths, no bridge word is inserted.
 * In the output poem, input words retain their original case, while bridge
 * words are lower case. The whitespace between every word in the poem is a
 * single space.
 * 
 * <p>For example, given this corpus:
 * <pre>    This is a test of the Mugar Omni Theater sound system.    </pre>
 * <p>on this input:
 * <pre>    Test the system.    </pre>
 * <p>the output poem would be:
 * <pre>    Test of the system.    </pre>
 * 
 * <p>PS2 instructions: this is a required ADT class, and you MUST NOT weaken
 * the required specifications. However, you MAY strengthen the specifications
 * and you MAY add additional methods.
 * You MUST use Graph in your rep, but otherwise the implementation of this
 * class is up to you.
